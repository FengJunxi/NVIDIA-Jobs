### GPU SM ARCHITECT--PERFORMANCE /FUNCTIONAL MODELING, VALIDATION AND ANALYSIS of SHADER UNIT

#### NVIDIA's GPUs and SOCs are world leaders in performance and efficiency, and the SM (streaming multi-processor, or the shader unit) is the core of its gigantic processing power. The SM architects define, design and implement the state of the art SM architecture powering next generation GPU. They aggressively solve challenging technical problems and prudently make design trade-offs between performance, power and cost, to deliver the best result. Do you want to work with a most professional arch team to design/implement/verify units/simulators/testbenches of GPUs in a most leading company inside the industry? Do you have solid knowledge of computer architecture and are eager to contribute your expertise to the design of a chip and help make it more popular? Great chance to work here.

#### Location: Shanghai  

##### What you’ll be doing:
o	Investigate and propose architecture ideas based on quantitative study of existing and projected SM architecture.
o	Develop performance and functional simulation models.
o	Develop testplan and tests to validate new SM architectural and features from both performance and function perspectives.
o	Test and debug on simulators, RTL and real silicon.


##### What we need to see: 
o	In depth knowledge of computer architecture, with excellent understanding of modern ISA and microprocessor implementation techniques.
o	Outstanding understanding of GPU concept and pipeline, in terms of graphics processing and parallel compute.
o	Deep understanding of C++ language and at least 3 years of C/C++ development experience.
o	Experience of performance/functional modelling, profiling and analysis is helpful.
o	Experience with trace driven and execution driven simulation model development is helpful.
o	BSEE, BSCSE, or equivalent required. MS or PhD is a plus.
o	Experience of GPU shader unit design, microprocessor design, and CPU/GPU performance analysis is helpful.
