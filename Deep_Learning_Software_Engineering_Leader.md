### Deep Learning Software Engineering Leader -  Shanghai
____
NVIDIA is hiring a Deep Learning Software Leader for its Self Driving Car Deep Learning team. Academic and commercial groups around the world are powering a revolution in artificial intelligence using deep learning techniques running on NVIDIA GPUs, enabling breakthroughs in problems from image classification to speech recognition to natural language processing.

Intelligent machines powered by AI computers that can learn, reason and interact with people are no longer science fiction. Today, a self-driving car powered by AI can meander through a country road at night and find its way. An AI-powered robot can learn motor skills through trial and error. This is truly an extraordinary time. The era of AI has begun.

#### What you’ll be doing:
- Leading and providing technical direction to a diverse team of deep learning engineering talent
- Inventing and applying state of the art deep learning algorithms to solve problems related to building autonomous vehicles.
- Work on object detection, classification and segmentation based on images, radar and lidar data.
- Interaction with various internal product and research teams contributing toward building a self driving car software solution as well as partners and customers

#### What we need to see:
- You should have experience of directing a team and have successfully shipped product.
- Ability to manage and technically direct a team of applied researchers and engineers, define project goals and scope, and coordinate multiple development efforts.
- You have deep expertise in deep learning algorithms, machine learning, or nonlinear optimization.
- Excellent programming, software design, and testing skills in Python, C++, or similar languages
- Masters or PhD or equivalent experience in Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence, Applied Math, or related field.

#### Ways to stand out from the crowd:
- Experience with deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow, CNTK, Caffe, Torch, or Theano, especially for computer vision
- Participation in deep learning competitions where you finished in the top 5
- Experience with data-parallel and/or accelerated computing (CUDA, OpenCL)
- Experience with embedded architectures, including DSP and hardware accelerators

GPU computing is the most productive and pervasive platform for deep learning and AI. It begins with the most advanced GPUs and the systems and software we build on top of them. We integrate and optimize every deep learning framework. We work with the major systems companies and every major cloud service provider to make GPUs available in data centers and in the cloud and we create computers and software to bring AI to edge devices, such as self-driving cars and autonomous robots

With deep learning, we can teach AI to do almost anything. New internet services, like Google Assistant, have learned speech from sound and provide a more natural way to access information. Self-driving cars use deep learning to recognize the space the car inhabits, the lanes in which it drives, and the objects to avoid. In healthcare, neural networks trained with millions of medical images can find clues in MRIs that until now could only be found through invasive biopsies. These are just a few examples. AI will spur a wave of social progress unmatched since the industrial revolution.

Nvidia is widely considered to be one of the technology world’s most desirable employers. We have some of the most brilliant and talented people in the world working for us. Are you creative and autonomous? Do you love a challenge? If so, we want to hear from you. Come, join our Deep Learning Software team and help us build the real-time, cost-effective computing platform driving our success in this dynamic and quickly growing field.
